# MiniLM [RNN]

This repository provides an implementation of a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** model for natural language processing tasks. The main goal is to demonstrate how to apply an RNN to text data using MiniLM, a lightweight language model, to extract meaningful features from text.

## Overview

This project combines MiniLM embeddings with a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture to process text data and derive meaningful representations for various tasks, such as text classification or sentiment analysis. The implementation uses PyTorch as the primary framework for building and training the model, ensuring the approach is both flexible and modular.

### Features
- **MiniLM Embeddings**: Uses MiniLM to generate contextual embeddings for the input text.
- **RNN Architecture**: Implements a basic RNN model to process token sequences and generate predictions.
- **PyTorch-Based**: Built using PyTorch, making it easy to modify or integrate into other projects.

### Architecture

The RNN model has the following architecture:

1. **Embedding Layer**: Uses MiniLM to create contextual embeddings for each token in the input.
2. **RNN Layer**: A standard RNN layer (or optionally GRU/LSTM) processes these embeddings and learns sequential patterns.
3. **Fully Connected Layer**: Produces predictions using the RNN's final hidden state.

## Usage

The main script can be used to train and evaluate the RNN model with custom datasets. The general workflow includes:

1. **Prepare the Dataset**: Load and preprocess the dataset, converting text into token sequences.
2. **Initialize MiniLM**: Use MiniLM to generate embeddings for the preprocessed text.
3. **Train the Model**: Train the RNN model using the provided training pipeline.
4. **Evaluate**: Assess model performance using relevant metrics.

### Example Workflow

```python
# Load and preprocess data
text_data = ["Sample text input..."]
preprocessed_data = preprocess(text_data)

# Generate embeddings
embeddings = generate_minilm_embeddings(preprocessed_data)

# Train the RNN model
train_model(embeddings)
```
